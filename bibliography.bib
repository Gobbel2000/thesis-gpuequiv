  abstract   = {Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a core primitive for graph traversal and a basis for many higher-level graph analysis algorithms. It is also representative of a class of parallel computations whose memory accesses and work distribution are both irregular and data dependent. Recent work has demonstrated the plausibility of GPU sparse graph traversal, but has tended to focus on asymptotically inefficient algorithms that perform poorly on graphs with nontrivial diameter. We present a BFS parallelization focused on fine-grained task management constructed from efficient prefix sum computations that achieves an asymptotically optimal O({\textbar}V{\textbar} + {\textbar}E{\textbar}) gd work complexity. Our implementation delivers excellent performance on diverse graphs, achieving traversal rates in excess of 3.3 billion and 8.3 billion traversed edges per second using single- and quad-GPU configurations, respectively. This level of performance is several times faster than state-of-the-art implementations on both CPU and GPU platforms.},

  abstract   = {Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have emerged as powerful accelerators for many regular algorithms that operate on dense arrays and matrices. In contrast, we know relatively little about using GPUs to accelerate highly irregular algorithms that operate on pointer-based data structures such as graphs. For the most part, research has focused on GPU implementations of graph analysis algorithms that do not modify the structure of the graph, such as algorithms for breadth-first search and strongly-connected components. In this paper, we describe a high-performance GPU implementation of an important graph algorithm used in compilers such as gcc and LLVM: Andersen-style inclusion-based points-to analysis. This algorithm is challenging to parallelize effectively on GPUs because it makes extensive modifications to the structure of the underlying graph and performs relatively little computation. In spite of this, our program, when executed on a 14 Streaming Multiprocessor GPU, achieves an average speedup of 7x compared to a sequential CPU implementation and outperforms a parallel implementation of the same algorithm running on 16 CPU cores. Our implementation provides general insights into how to produce high-performance GPU implementations of graph algorithms, and it highlights key differences between optimizing parallel programs for multicore CPUs and for GPUs.},

Even on Vulkan, there are some sharp edges to watch out for.},

Several testing scenarios, motivating these semantics, are presented, phrased in terms of `button pushing experiments' on generative and reactive machines. Finally nine of these semantics are applied to a simple language for finite, concrete, sequential, nondeterministic processes, and for each of them a complete axiomatization is provided.},

In the attempt to extend the size of the state spaces that can be dealt with, we designed and implemented a bisimulation reduction algorithm for distributed memory settings using message passing communication. By using message passing, the same implementation can be used on both large SMP machines and clusters of workstations. The algorithm performs reduction of large labeled transition systems modulo strong bisimulation. We justify its correctness and termination. We provide an evaluation of the worst-case time and message complexity and some performance data from a prototype implementation. Both theory and practice show that the algorithm scales up with the number of workers.},

An abstract algorithm that solves the problem is given in [A{\v{C}}JT96,FS99]. The algorithm computes the closure of the predecessor operator w.r.t. a given upward-closed set of target states. When applied to this class of verification problems, traditional (infinite-state) symbolic model checkers suffer from the state explosion problem even for very small examples. We provide BDD-like data structures to represent in a compact way collections of upwards closed sets over numerical domains. This way, we turn the abstract algorithm of [A{\v{C}}JT96,FS99] into a practical method. Preliminary experimental results indicate the potential usefulness of our method.},
